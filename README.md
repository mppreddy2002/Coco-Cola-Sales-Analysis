# Coco-Cola-Sales-Analysis
I analyzed the sales data for key American Coca-Cola retailers in 2021, focusing on budget sales and operating margins. I present insights on monthly total sales, units sold per region, and the performance of different beverage brands, highlighting that sales peaked in December and dipped in March. I also discuss the best-performing retailers and the contribution of each brand to total sales, noting that Coca-Cola leads while Fanta has the least. I encourage you to review the visualizations and insights provided to better understand our sales trends and regional performances. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the data presented.
